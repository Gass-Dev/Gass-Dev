# Hi, I'm Gass 👋

Front-end developer specializing in **React and TypeScript**.  
I design and implement reusable components, integrate APIs, and work with modern front-end tools.  
I focus on understanding **how a solution works**, not just making it work, and I continuously deepen my knowledge of **core concepts** and **best practices** in front-end development.

## 🔭 Currently learning
- Scalable front-end architecture and advanced React patterns
- State management with Redux / Zustand
- Unit and integration testing (Jest, React Testing Library)
- Front-end security and performance
- Deploiement

## ⚡ Tech Stack
React | TypeScript | JavaScript | HTML | CSS | Jest | React Testing Library | Git | CI/CD | Docker | Confluence | Agile

## 🌱 Fun fact
I love understanding how things work under the hood from code to browser rendering.
